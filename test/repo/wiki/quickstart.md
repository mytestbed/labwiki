# LabWiki Quickstart Guide

LabWiki is a web application which provides you with tools to **plan**, 
**execute**, **observe**, and **review** series of experiments. It accompanies 
you through the entire life-cycle of an experiment-based study, **recording** 
each steps along the way.

## 1. Plan your study

The **Plan** panel is where you document your study and experiments. There you
can describe for example your experiment's notes, or hypothesis, or models, etc...

To display a previously saved document, just type its name in the search
field, for example this quickstart guide's name `quickstart.md`

## 2. Prepare your experiment

The **Prepare** panel allows you to create, edit and view your experiment
description, which is written using the [OEDL language.](http://mytestbed.net/projects/omf6/wiki/OEDLOMF6)

To **create** a new experiment description, click on the "+" sign, enter a new 
filename, select "OEDL", and click on the "Create" button.

To **view** and **edit** an experiment description, type its name in the search
field, for example the simple experiment `helloworld.rb`.

After editing your experiment, do not forget to save it by clicking on the disk 
icon.

## 3. Execute your experiment

In the **Execute** panel, you configure and run your experiment, as well as
view its progress and any defined graphs.

First, load an experiment description in the **Prepare** panel. For 
example, load the `helloworld.rb`, then drag and drop the pen-and-paper icon 
from the **Prepare** to the **Execute** panel.

You can now **configure** the parameters of your experiment, and press the Start
button to **run** the experiment!

## 4. Observe and analyse

While the experiment is running you can view its properties, any defined graph,
and any message it produces.

## 5. Review and discuss

When your experiment is finished, you can update your experiment notes with your
results, conclusions etc... In the **Prepare** panel, just type the name of your
previously saved notes, e.g. `quickstart.md`. You can then **edit** the document 
using the [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 
Do not forget to **save** the document by clicking on the disk button.

To view your edits, drag and drop the pen-and-paper icon from the **Prepare**
to the **Plan** panel.

To add a graph to your experiment notes, drag and drop the graph icon below your
graph in the **Execute** panel into the **Plan** panel.

## 6. Repeat...

Now it is time to take on-board all the results and conclusions from your
previous experiment, to design and run the next one!
